## Planning and Development Process

First day I had a hard time to understand the logic, because when you see the game from outside, you think it is a really easy game, but when you want to develope it and create it,  gets very complicated. Second day I did the table and put the X by click. third day I completed to let two players play and also tells you  when you win or draw. Last thing I did the css to make it pretty and comfortable for eyes

### Problem-Solving Strategy

For me I foucs to see if there is any syntax error and then I put console.log or I google it.

### Unsolved problems

I just didnt do the AI part
