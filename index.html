        <h1> Tic Tac Toe Instroctions </h1>

        <h4> The best move, if you go first, is to go in the center. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. If you go in the middle, you will have the highest chance of winning the game.<br/> And if you let your opponent go there, you will have the highest chance of losing. And you don't want that, do you?
                If you don't go in the center, your next best move is to go in one of the four corners.<br/> That way, if your opponent does not choose the center (and a novice player may not), then you have a high chance of winning.
                Avoid the edges as a first move. The edges are the four boxes that are neither the center or the corner. If you go here first, you will have the smallest chance of winning.</h4>

        <h2>  	HOW CAN YOU WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE? </h2>
            <h4> To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. <br/> Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.

                    Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. <br/>The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.
                    
                    After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead.<br/> Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.<br/>
                    
                    You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. <br/>That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.<br/>
                    
                    If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.
